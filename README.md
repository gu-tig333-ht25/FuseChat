# FuseChat ðŸ’¬  
*A Group Chat App with AI-Powered Reply Suggestions*

FuseChat is a Flutter-based mobile application that brings a creative twist to group messaging.  
Users can chat in real time while receiving AI-generated message suggestions based on a configurable personality â€” such as **factual**, **mischievous**, or **supportive**.  
Written as a group project for the course "Mobile app development with Flutter" at GU.

The app explores how large language models (LLMs) can enhance and enrich human-to-human conversations.

## Firebase

The app depends on a Firebase account. If the original account is not available in the future,
or if you want to make your own version of the app, you need to set up Firebase.
Create a Firebase account, enable authentication, and enable Cloud Firestore.
